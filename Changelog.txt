** Fixed a bug in Mem.cs in bit masking, caused all pages to resolve to the same address

** Improved VMWare support, no need for vmss2core, tested for VMWare format 11/12

** Doing a deep copy with DetectdProc need to see if there is some state issues or if we can recycle 

** ExtractAS will reject an EPTP if a single grouped Process fails entirely (0 PTE entries able to be reconciled)
**** Should add a force option to keep trying regardless, however this is likely/maybe a waste

** DumpASToFile is a bit more functional now.
